  Supercharge your shell scripts - Run shell scripts in batch, concurrently, fully customized with variable .

## What is it?
At the first point of view, I want to create a tool which can help our team run the bash script easier, faster, safer, with clearly reports, so I build RFSH.

To me, the first ability of good software is privacy matter. I want to create a good software and I don't want to make rich by charging on things running on your own resources (your computer, your server, your cloud,...). So basically, RFSH will be free-forever for usage.

You put a .csv file, a bash script as a template file, RFSH will take care the rest, then you will receive the clearly reports after all. Things happen on your machine, safe and sound.

For **supercharge** features, you must include the [--auth-phrase](#--auth-phrase). You can renew it anytime, free & forever.

## Features
1. Concurrently run a template with values from a CSV file, url. [link](#basic).
2. Generate an all-in-one job file which contains input data, template script, command flags that can run anywhere [link](#help).
3. Send reports to remotely stream. Support: telegram (**supercharge**) [link](#basic).

## Sample
Run the following script to execute the basic sample. You can find the script, input data, template at [sample](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/tree/main/sample):
 ```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsion/rfsh/main/sample/892d2fc4-6294-11ee-bffe-f297ad799bdb.sh | sh
#
# |- generated by:
# |- $runflow --generate-job basic -i https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.csv -t https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.template
```

Console output:

### Github
You can import input(-i) / template(-t) file from Github repo. Please note that, if you use private Github repository, please set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable before running $runflow command. For example:
 ```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> runflow basic -i https://github.com/my/privaterepo/blob/main/sample/sample.csv -t https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.template
```

You can find Github guideline [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) to generate new token.
