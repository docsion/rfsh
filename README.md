  Supercharge your shell scripts - Run shell scripts in batch, concurrently, fully customized with variable .
</p>


## What is it?
At the first point of view, I want to create a tool which can help our team run the bash script easier, faster, safer, with clearly reports, so I build RFSH.

To me, the first ability of good software is privacy matter. I want to create a good software and I don't want to make rich by charging on things running on your own resources (your computer, your server, your cloud,...). So basically, RFSH will be free-forever for usage.

You put a .csv file, a bash script as a template file, RFSH will take care the rest, then you will receive the clearly reports after all. Things happen on your machine, safe and sound.

## How it works?
RFSH works by 3 simple steps:
1. Parse your .csv file to a list of variable and its value, `variable_name` defined at the first row of the .csv file.
2. Combine value + template file, by `{{variable_name}}` matching, to scripts.
3. Run scripts concurrently.

## Features
1. Concurrently run a template with values from a CSV file, url, github, google spreadsheets.
2. Generate an all-in-one job file which contains input data, template script, command flags that can run anywhere.
3. Send reports to remotely stream. Support: telegram.
4. Customize the exports .csv file.
5. Test runs result with template script.
6. Show meme at the end of reports \ **supercharge** / 💅

## Sample
### Basic
Run the following script to execute the basic job sample. You can find the script, input data, template at [sample](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/tree/main/sample):
 ```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsion/rfsh/main/sample/30969f5a-6369-11ee-a32e-f297ad799bdb.sh | sh
#
# |- generated by:
# |- $runflow --generate-job basic -i https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.csv -t https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.template
```

Output:

## Flag

### --template
Template is the require bash script when using RFSH. It's a bash script file, so you can write anything you want in bash. RFSH will pass the value from `--input` to your `--template` by matching `{{variable_name}}`. 

You can find the sample at [sample/sample.template](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.template):

 ```
echo "hello bash runner {{id}} {{content}}"
```

You can also use [built-in](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/script/built_in.sh) functions in template file, likes [sample/built-in/item.template.sh](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/built-in/item.template.sh):

  ```
rf_http https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{{id}}.json
```

### --test-template
You can write test with `--test-template`. Runflow will pass the result as input data (stdin) to your test template file after running script. Please note that, the input result is base64 encoded as default. Use `exit` command to mark the result as bad. You can also retrive the variable with format `{{variable_name}}` .

Run the following job script to explore how it works:
 ```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsion/rfsh/main/sample/30969f5a-6369-11ee-a32e-f297ad799bdb.sh | sh
#
# |- generated by:
# |- $runflow --generate-job basic -i sample/sample.csv -t sample/sample.template --test-template sample/sample.test.template --export-template sample/sample.export.template
```

You can find sample test at [sample/sample.test.template](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.test.template):
 ```
BASE64_RESULT_IN=$(cat) # RESULT FROM SCRIPT RUNS

# DECODE BEFORE USING $echo $BASE64_RESULT_IN | base64 --decode
RESULT_IN=$(echo $BASE64_RESULT_IN | base64 --decode)

# TEST START HERE
if [[ ! "$RESULT_IN" =~ "{{id}}" ]];
then 
	echo "ops!!!" >&2 # print to stderr
	exit 1
fi

echo "good" "{{content}}"
```

Or using built-in function [sample/built-in/item.test.template.sh](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/built-in/item.test.template.sh)
 ```
# http status
rf_asserts "Status 200" \
	200 \
	$(rf_result_in | jq -r '.response_code')
```

### --export-template
If you want to add more column the export .csv (--output) file. Use --export-template options. You receive the input JSON result (via stdin), customize then reply the output as JSON with format: `{"new_column_name": "new_column_value"}`. Please note that, the input result is base64 encoded as default. 

Run the following job script to explore how it works:
 ```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsion/rfsh/main/sample/30969f5a-6369-11ee-a32e-f297ad799bdb.sh | sh
#
# |- generated by:
# |- $runflow --generate-job basic -i sample/sample.csv -t sample/sample.template --test-template sample/sample.test.template --export-template sample/sample.export.template
```

You can find sample test at [sample/sample.export.template](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.export.template):
 ```
BASE64_RESULT_IN=$(cat) # RESULT FROM SCRIPT RUNS

# DECODE BEFORE USING $echo ${BASE64_RESULT_IN} | base64 --decode

# CUSTOM EXPORT START HERE
value="ohhh!"

# THEN OUTPUT JSON
echo '{"new_custom_column_name": "'$value'"}'
```

### --built-in
RFSH support built-in functions to help you writing template easier. You can find the latest built-in functions at [script/built_in.sh](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/script/built_in.sh). And, check it out [sample/built-in](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/tree/main/sample/built-in) to understand how easy it is.

### --auth-phrase
> Provide an auth phrase to automatically authenticate the running flow as your *supercharge*

You can find the --auth-phrase [here](auth_phrase.txt) for the period running flows (phrase will be expired in 3 months - You can renew it anytime, free & forever). Or Buy me a coffee ($1) with [ a Lifetime --auth-phrase](https://docsion.com/product/rfsh) (END SOON!!! 🏄‍♀️ 481/500 remains, thanks to 19 supporters 🙏).

## Github
You can import an input or a template file from Github repository. Note that if you use private repository, please set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable before running $runflow command. For example:
 ```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> runflow basic -i https://github.com/my/privaterepo/blob/main/sample/sample.csv -t https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/blob/main/sample/sample.template
```

You can find Github guideline [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) to generate new token.

## Telegram
You can send reports to Telegram with Telegram bots, check Telegram guidline [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots). Please note that, the channel must be in public.
