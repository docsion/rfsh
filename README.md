  A Free-forever flows running tool. üí•
</p>

> a.k.a @RUNFLOW_SH

## What is it?
At the first point of view, I want to create a tool which can help our team run the bash script easier, faster, safer, with clearly reports, so I build RFSH.

To me, the first ability of good software must have is privacy matter, then the basic needs should be fulfilled. I want to create a good software and I don't want to make rich by charging on things running on your own resources (your computer, your sever, your cloud,...). So basically, RFSH will be free-forever for usage.

You can put a .csv file, a bash script as template file, rfsh will take care the rest, then you will receive the cleary reports after all. Thing happens on your machine, safe and sound.

For **supercharge** features, you must incluce the [--auth-phrase](#--auth-phrase). The free version of it will have shorter life-time, you can renew it anytime, free & forever.

## Features
1. Concurrently run a template with values from a CSV file [link](#basic).
2. Generate an all-in-one job file which contains input data, template script, command flags that can run anywhere [link](#help).
3. Send reports to remote stream. Support: telegram (**supercharge**) [link](#basic).

## Sample
Run the following script to execute the basic sample. You can find script, input, template at [sample](https://github.com/docsion/rfsh/tree/main/sample):
 ```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsion/rfsh/main/sample/f6f89824-5d10-11ee-8c9d-f297ad799bdb.sh | sh
#
# |- generated by:
# |- $runflow --generate-job basic -t sample/sample.template -i sample/sample.csv -o sample.out.csv --retries 2
```

## Install
